# Product Context

## Purpose
The Drone Mission Planning Dashboard is designed to help field operations managers plan and collaborate on drone missions. The primary goal is to enable users to upload mission flight paths, view them on an interactive map, and collaborate with teammates by adding annotations and defining no-fly zones.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Mission Planning**: Users should be able to easily upload KML files and view the flight paths on an interactive map.
2. **Collaboration**: Team members should be able to add annotations and define no-fly zones, with updates persisting across sessions.
3. **Multiple Mission Support**: The dashboard should support multiple missions, allowing users to switch between them.
4. **Real-time Updates**: (Stretch goal) Annotations from other users should be visible in real-time without requiring a page refresh.

## Key Features
- Upload and render KML mission files
- Add annotation pins with text notes
- Draw no-fly zones (polygons) with text notes
- Persist updates across sessions
- Support for multiple missions
