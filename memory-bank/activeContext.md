# Active Context

## Current State
- Memory bank initialization complete
- React project for frontend has been set up
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Full frontend-backend API integration for KML file processing
- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Python backend completely refactored with production-ready infrastructure
- Solid REST API foundation established with comprehensive error handling, logging, and security
- Database models created for missions, annotations, and no-fly zones
- REST API endpoints implemented for mission management
- **NEW**: Complete KML parsing and waypoint extraction system implemented
- **NEW**: Frontend TypeScript conversion with proper API integration
- **NEW**: Comprehensive unit testing suite for KML parser (7 tests, all passing)
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Mission Tab Bar Navigation System
- **NEW**: Persistent waypoint storage in database (no more re-parsing KML files)
- **NEW**: Complete mission navigation UI with tab bar above map

## Next Steps
1. **NEXT**: Implement waypoint visualization on the map (display selected mission's waypoints)
2. Implement annotation pins and no-fly zones on the map
3. Add mission management UI (edit, delete missions)
4. Implement real-time updates (stretch goal)
5. Add comprehensive frontend error handling and validation
6. Address TODOs in the project

## Recent Changes
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed frontend-backend API connectivity issue
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Corrected React environment variable naming convention
  - Changed `API_BASE_URL` to `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in frontend/.env
  - Updated missionService.ts to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`
  - Fixed TypeScript type definitions to match correct variable names
  - Root cause: React only exposes environment variables with `REACT_APP_` prefix to browser
- **Complete API Integration**: Frontend now successfully communicates with backend for KML processing
- **KML Parser Implementation**: Robust KML parsing with DJI drone format support
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Added mission service layer for business logic separation
- **TypeScript Migration**: Converted FileUpload component from JavaScript to TypeScript
- **API Service Creation**: Built TypeScript API service using native fetch (no axios dependency)
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for KML parser with 100% pass rate
- **Error Handling**: End-to-end error handling from frontend to backend
- **File Upload Flow**: Complete multipart file upload with mission creation
- **Waypoint Extraction**: Parses and returns structured waypoint data with coordinates and altitude
- **Backend Infrastructure Overhaul**: Complete refactoring of Python backend
- Fixed critical circular import issues and package structure
- Implemented application factory pattern with environment-specific configurations
- Added comprehensive error handling framework with custom exceptions
- Established structured logging with file rotation and request tracking
- Created standardized API response framework
- Added security middleware with CORS, security headers, and health checks
- Consolidated application structure and removed duplicate files
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Resolved Flask application lifecycle error in middleware.py
- Fixed improper @app.after_request decorator registration that was causing server crashes
- Refactored add_api_versioning function to comply with Flask's application setup rules
- **NEW MAJOR MILESTONE**: Map Component Implementation Completed (no missions displayed yet)
- Created Mapbox-integrated Map component with satellite view optimized for drone missions
- Implemented Header component with upload button for clean UI separation
- Built Modal component system for hiding FileUpload behind user interaction
- Restructured App.js for map-centric layout with Header + Map + Modal architecture
- Added comprehensive responsive styling for mobile and desktop experiences
- Fixed TypeScript environment variable configuration for Mapbox token access
- FileUpload component now works seamlessly in modal with success callbacks
- Map component includes proper error handling, loading states, and navigation controls
- Complete UI transformation: FileUpload hidden behind button, Map as centerpiece (80-90% of screen)
- **LATEST MAJOR MILESTONE**: Mission Tab Bar Navigation System Completed
- **Database Enhancement**: Added Waypoint model with persistent storage of parsed KML waypoints
- **Backend Enhancement**: Modified mission service to save waypoints during KML upload (no re-parsing needed)
- **Frontend Component**: Created MissionTabBar component with responsive design and proper styling
- **State Management**: Implemented complete mission state management in App.js with loading/error states
- **UI Integration**: Integrated tab bar between Header and Map with clean layout
- **UX Improvement**: Removed duplicate upload button from Header, kept only in tab bar
- **API Enhancement**: Enhanced get_all_missions endpoint to include waypoint data for tab bar
- **Mission Navigation**: Tab selection system ready for map waypoint visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Tab bar works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow Flask best practices with application factory pattern
- Use standardized API responses with success/error indicators and request tracking
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Apply security headers and proper CORS configuration
- Follow the project brief for feature implementation
- Use React for the frontend and Python for the backend
- Use Mapbox for the map component
- Implement persistent storage using SQLite for development

## Technical Insights & Learnings
- Application factory pattern provides better testability and configuration management
- Standardized error handling prevents information leakage and improves debugging
- Request ID tracking enables better tracing across distributed systems
- Health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring
- Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities
- Structured logging with rotation prevents disk space issues in production
