# Active Context

## Current State
- Memory bank initialization complete
- React project for frontend has been set up
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Full frontend-backend API integration for KML file processing
- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Python backend completely refactored with production-ready infrastructure
- Solid REST API foundation established with comprehensive error handling, logging, and security
- Database models created for missions, annotations, and no-fly zones
- REST API endpoints implemented for mission management
- **NEW**: Complete KML parsing and waypoint extraction system implemented
- **NEW**: Frontend TypeScript conversion with proper API integration
- **NEW**: Comprehensive unit testing suite for KML parser (7 tests, all passing)

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Mapbox for map rendering and waypoint visualization
2. Implement annotation pins and no-fly zones on the map
3. Add mission management UI (list, edit, delete missions)
4. Implement real-time updates (stretch goal)
5. Add comprehensive frontend error handling and validation
6. Address TODOs in the project

## Recent Changes
- **Complete API Integration**: Frontend now successfully communicates with backend for KML processing
- **KML Parser Implementation**: Robust KML parsing with DJI drone format support
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Added mission service layer for business logic separation
- **TypeScript Migration**: Converted FileUpload component from JavaScript to TypeScript
- **API Service Creation**: Built TypeScript API service using native fetch (no axios dependency)
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for KML parser with 100% pass rate
- **Error Handling**: End-to-end error handling from frontend to backend
- **File Upload Flow**: Complete multipart file upload with mission creation
- **Waypoint Extraction**: Parses and returns structured waypoint data with coordinates and altitude
- **Backend Infrastructure Overhaul**: Complete refactoring of Python backend
- Fixed critical circular import issues and package structure
- Implemented application factory pattern with environment-specific configurations
- Added comprehensive error handling framework with custom exceptions
- Established structured logging with file rotation and request tracking
- Created standardized API response framework
- Added security middleware with CORS, security headers, and health checks
- Consolidated application structure and removed duplicate files
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Resolved Flask application lifecycle error in middleware.py
- Fixed improper @app.after_request decorator registration that was causing server crashes
- Refactored add_api_versioning function to comply with Flask's application setup rules

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow Flask best practices with application factory pattern
- Use standardized API responses with success/error indicators and request tracking
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Apply security headers and proper CORS configuration
- Follow the project brief for feature implementation
- Use React for the frontend and Python for the backend
- Use Mapbox for the map component
- Implement persistent storage using SQLite for development

## Technical Insights & Learnings
- Application factory pattern provides better testability and configuration management
- Standardized error handling prevents information leakage and improves debugging
- Request ID tracking enables better tracing across distributed systems
- Health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring
- Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities
- Structured logging with rotation prevents disk space issues in production
