## Next Steps
1. **NEXT**: Implement annotation pins and no-fly zones on the map
2. Implement real-time updates (stretch goal)
3. Continue with remaining project features as outlined in project brief

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Frontend Refactoring and Unit Testing
- **Frontend Code Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup and TypeScript consistency improvements
  - Removed unused files: `logo.svg`, `reportWebVitals.js`
  - Converted `App.js` to `App.tsx` with proper TypeScript types and interfaces
  - Fixed outdated `App.test.js` and converted to TypeScript
  - Marked future features in `missionService.ts` (annotation and no-fly zone functions)
- **Reusable Component Architecture**: Created standardized UI components
  - `ErrorMessage.tsx` - Standardized error display with SCSS styling
  - `LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Consistent loading states with SCSS styling
  - `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Global error boundary for unhandled errors
  - Implemented global error boundary in `index.js` wrapping the entire app
- **Map Component Refactoring**: Split large Map component into focused custom hooks
  - `useMapbox.ts` - Handles map initialization, controls, cleanup, and resize (60 lines)
  - `useWaypointVisualization.ts` - Returns functions for waypoint management (80 lines)
  - Refactored `Map.tsx` - Reduced from 200+ to 40 lines, much cleaner and maintainable
  - Improved separation of concerns and eliminated code duplication
- **Comprehensive Frontend Unit Testing**: Created 12 comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - ErrorMessage component (2 tests)
  - LoadingSpinner component (3 tests)
  - missionService API functions (4 tests with mocked fetch)
  - App component integration (3 tests with proper mocking)
  - All tests properly mock dependencies (Mapbox GL JS, API services, custom hooks)
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced type safety and consistency
  - Updated service types to match actual API responses
  - Fixed interface mismatches between components
  - Maintained strict TypeScript configuration
  - Consistent TypeScript usage across all components

- **PREVIOUS MILESTONE**: Backend Refactoring and Unit Testing
- **API Response Standardization**: Refactored all routes to use standardized `api_response()` helper function
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Split large `MissionService.create_mission_from_kml()` method into focused helper methods
- **Backend Unit Test Suite**: Created 28 comprehensive backend unit tests (all passing)
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Enhanced code quality with better separation of concerns

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow Flask best practices with application factory pattern
- Use standardized API responses with success/error indicators and request tracking
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Apply security headers and proper CORS configuration
- Follow the project brief for feature implementation
- Use React for the frontend and Python for the backend
- Use Mapbox for the map component
- Implement persistent storage using SQLite for development

## Technical Insights & Learnings
- Application factory pattern provides better testability and configuration management
- Standardized error handling prevents information leakage and improves debugging
- Request ID tracking enables better tracing across distributed systems
- Health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring
- Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities
- Structured logging with rotation prevents disk space issues in production
- **Frontend Architecture Patterns**: Custom hooks provide excellent separation of concerns for complex components
- **Component Refactoring**: Breaking large components (200+ lines) into focused hooks dramatically improves maintainability
- **TypeScript Consistency**: Converting mixed JS/TS codebases to full TypeScript improves type safety and developer experience
- **Reusable Components**: Standardized ErrorMessage and LoadingSpinner components eliminate code duplication across the application
- **Global Error Boundaries**: Essential for production React applications to handle unhandled errors gracefully
- **Jest Testing Patterns**: Proper mocking of external dependencies (Mapbox, API services, custom hooks) is crucial for reliable tests
- **Test Organization**: Separating component tests, service tests, and integration tests provides better test coverage and maintainability
