# Active Context

## Current State
- Memory bank initialization complete
- React project for frontend has been set up
- File upload component implemented
- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Python backend completely refactored with production-ready infrastructure
- Solid REST API foundation established with comprehensive error handling, logging, and security
- Database models created for missions, annotations, and no-fly zones
- REST API endpoints implemented for mission management

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Mapbox for map rendering
2. Implement core features as outlined in the project brief
3. Connect frontend to backend API
4. Define final data structures and validation rules
5. Implement business logic for KML processing

## Recent Changes
- **Backend Infrastructure Overhaul**: Complete refactoring of Python backend
- Fixed critical circular import issues
- Implemented application factory pattern with environment-specific configurations
- Added comprehensive error handling framework with custom exceptions
- Established structured logging with file rotation and request tracking
- Created standardized API response framework
- Added security middleware with CORS, security headers, and health checks
- Consolidated application structure and removed duplicate files

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow Flask best practices with application factory pattern
- Use standardized API responses with success/error indicators and request tracking
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Apply security headers and proper CORS configuration
- Follow the project brief for feature implementation
- Use React for the frontend and Python for the backend
- Use Mapbox for the map component
- Implement persistent storage using SQLite for development

## Technical Insights & Learnings
- Application factory pattern provides better testability and configuration management
- Standardized error handling prevents information leakage and improves debugging
- Request ID tracking enables better tracing across distributed systems
- Health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring
- Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities
- Structured logging with rotation prevents disk space issues in production
