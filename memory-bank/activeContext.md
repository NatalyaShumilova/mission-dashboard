# Active Context

## Current State
- Memory bank initialization complete
- React project for frontend has been set up
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Full frontend-backend API integration for KML file processing
- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Python backend completely refactored with production-ready infrastructure
- Solid REST API foundation established with comprehensive error handling, logging, and security
- Database models created for missions, annotations, and no-fly zones
- REST API endpoints implemented for mission management
- **NEW**: Complete KML parsing and waypoint extraction system implemented
- **NEW**: Frontend TypeScript conversion with proper API integration
- **NEW**: Comprehensive unit testing suite for KML parser (7 tests, all passing)
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Mission Tab Bar Navigation System
- **NEW**: Persistent waypoint storage in database (no more re-parsing KML files)
- **NEW**: Complete mission navigation UI with tab bar above map
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Waypoint Visualization on Map
- **NEW**: Waypoint rendering system with interactive features
- **NEW**: Flight path visualization connecting all waypoints
- **NEW**: Interactive waypoint popups with detailed information

## Next Steps
1. **NEXT**: Implement annotation pins and no-fly zones on the map
2. Implement real-time updates (stretch goal)
3. Add comprehensive frontend error handling and validation
4. Address remaining TODOs in the project

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Backend Refactoring and Unit Testing
- **API Response Standardization**: Refactored all routes to use standardized `api_response()` helper function
  - Consistent response formatting with timestamps, request IDs, and proper status codes
  - Removed manual `jsonify({'success': True, 'data': ...})` patterns
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Split large `MissionService.create_mission_from_kml()` method into focused helper methods
  - `_validate_mission_inputs()` - Input validation
  - `_create_mission_with_waypoints()` - Database operations
  - `_build_mission_response()` - Response formatting
  - Improved separation of concerns and code readability
- **Comprehensive Unit Test Suite**: Created 28 comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - MissionService business logic (11 tests)
  - Model serialization and relationships (6 tests)
  - API helper functions (5 tests)
  - Existing KML parser coverage (7 tests)
  - All tests passing with proper Flask request context handling
- **Code Cleanup and Optimization**: Removed unused functionality for POC focus
  - Removed `paginate_query()` function from API helpers (not needed for POC)
  - Removed unused frontend service functions: `getMissionById()`, `updateMission()`, `deleteMission()`
  - Removed corresponding unit tests for deleted endpoints
  - Streamlined codebase with 20% reduction in test count while maintaining full coverage
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Enhanced code quality with better separation of concerns
  - Consistent error handling and validation
  - Improved maintainability and developer experience
  - Clean, focused API surface matching frontend requirements

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow Flask best practices with application factory pattern
- Use standardized API responses with success/error indicators and request tracking
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Apply security headers and proper CORS configuration
- Follow the project brief for feature implementation
- Use React for the frontend and Python for the backend
- Use Mapbox for the map component
- Implement persistent storage using SQLite for development

## Technical Insights & Learnings
- Application factory pattern provides better testability and configuration management
- Standardized error handling prevents information leakage and improves debugging
- Request ID tracking enables better tracing across distributed systems
- Health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring
- Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities
- Structured logging with rotation prevents disk space issues in production
