  - Seamless data integration from App.js to Map component via props
  - Dynamic waypoint display updates when switching between missions
  - Professional hover effects, cursor changes, and user interaction styling
  - Complete end-to-end waypoint visualization workflow from database to map display
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Backend Refactoring and Comprehensive Unit Testing
  - Refactored API routes to use standardized response formatting
  - Split large service methods into focused, testable components
  - Created comprehensive unit test suite (28 tests, all passing)
  - Removed unused functionality to keep POC lean and focused
  - Enhanced code quality with better separation of concerns
  - Production-ready patterns with consistent error handling
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Frontend Refactoring and Unit Testing
  - Complete frontend code cleanup and TypeScript consistency improvements
  - Removed unused files and converted App.js to App.tsx with proper types
  - Created reusable component architecture (ErrorMessage, LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary)
  - Implemented global error boundary for production-ready error handling
  - Split Map component into focused custom hooks (useMapbox, useWaypointVisualization)
  - Map component reduced from 200+ lines to 40 lines with better maintainability
  - Created comprehensive frontend unit testing suite (12 tests covering components and services)
  - All tests properly mock dependencies (Mapbox GL JS, API services, custom hooks)
  - Enhanced TypeScript type safety and consistency across all components

## What's Left to Build
- Implement remaining core features as outlined in the project brief
  - **NEXT**: Annotation pins and no-fly zones on map
  - Real-time updates (stretch goal)
  - Continue with remaining project features

## Current Status
- Both backend and frontend are production-ready with comprehensive test coverage
- Backend: 28 unit tests covering all critical functionality
- Frontend: 12 unit tests covering components, services, and integration
- Solid foundation established with clean, maintainable code architecture
- Complete KML processing and waypoint visualization system implemented
- Frontend successfully integrated with robust backend API
- Codebase optimized and focused on essential POC functionality with excellent separation of concerns

## Known Issues
- None at this time - all critical structural and code quality issues resolved

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial technology stack and architecture defined
