# Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank initialization is complete
- Core files have been created:
  - productContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - progress.md
- React App has been initialized
- **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Complete frontend-backend API integration for KML processing
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Production-ready Python backend infrastructure completed
  - Application factory pattern with environment-specific configurations
  - Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
  - Structured logging with file rotation and request tracking
  - Standardized API response framework
  - Security middleware with CORS and security headers
  - Health check endpoints for monitoring
  - Database initialization working correctly
  - Application successfully running in development mode
- Database models created for missions, annotations, and no-fly zones
- REST API endpoints implemented for mission management
- **NEW FEATURES COMPLETED**:
  - KML file processing and parsing (DJI drone format support)
  - Frontend TypeScript FileUpload component with full functionality
  - Backend KML parser with comprehensive error handling
  - Mission service layer for business logic separation
  - Frontend API service using native fetch (TypeScript)
  - Complete file upload flow with multipart form data
  - Waypoint extraction with coordinates, altitude, and indexing
  - Unit testing suite for KML parser (7 tests, 100% pass rate)
  - End-to-end error handling from frontend to backend
  - SCSS styling for FileUpload component
  - Mission creation with unique IDs and KML storage

## What's Left to Build
- Implement remaining core features as outlined in the project brief
  - Map rendering with flight paths (Mapbox integration)
  - Waypoint visualization on map
  - Annotation pins and no-fly zones
  - Mission management UI (list, view, edit, delete missions)
  - Multiple mission support and switching
  - Real-time updates (stretch goal)
  - Address project TODOs

## Current Status
- Backend infrastructure is production-ready and fully functional
- Solid foundation established for building business logic
- Ready to implement data validation and KML processing
- Frontend can now be connected to the robust backend API

## Known Issues
- None at this time - all critical structural issues resolved

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial technology stack and architecture defined
- Core files created to document project context and progress
- **Major architectural improvement**: Refactored backend from basic Flask app to enterprise-grade REST API
- Established patterns for error handling, logging, and security that will scale with the application
- Created comprehensive documentation and development guidelines
- Implemented health monitoring and request tracking for operational visibility
